# OrangeHRM TEA Demo — Playwright + TypeScript

A production-ready end-to-end test automation suite for the public
[OrangeHRM demo site](https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/web/index.php/auth/login),
built by executing all **9 core workflows** of the BMad Method
**TEA (Test Engineering Architect)** framework.

- **Framework:** Playwright + TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Browser automation mode:** MCP (Model Context Protocol) — `tea_browser_automation: "mcp"`
- **Pattern:** Page Object Model, isolated-context auth fixture, network-first synchronization
- **Reference:** https://bmad-code-org.github.io/bmad-method-test-architecture-enterprise/

**Latest run:** ✅ 9 passed · 3 skipped (ATDD red-phase) · 0 failed (chromium).

---

## Project description

The suite validates the OrangeHRM authentication boundary, dashboard state and
session security using risk-based test design (P0–P3). Everything is produced and
governed by the TEA workflows: teaching → design → scaffold → CI → ATDD → automate
→ review → NFR audit → traceability & release gate.

---

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | 20.x | Pinned in [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) — run `nvm use` |
| npm | bundled with Node 20 | |
| Playwright browsers | chromium | installed via the command below |

---

## Setup

```bash
# 1. Use the pinned Node version
nvm use            # reads .nvmrc (Node 20)

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Install the chromium browser
npx playwright install chromium

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env          # macOS/Linux
# Copy-Item .env.example .env # Windows PowerShell
```

`.env` keys (defaults work out of the box against the public demo):

```
BASE_URL=https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com
ADMIN_USER=Admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=admin123
```

---

## How to run

### Local

```bash
npm test               # full suite
npm run test:smoke     # only @smoke tagged tests
npm run test:burn-in   # repeat each test 3x, no retries (flakiness check)
npm run test:headed    # watch it run in a real browser
npm run test:ui        # Playwright UI mode
npm run test:report    # open the last HTML report
npm run typecheck      # tsc --noEmit (strict)
```

### CI

GitHub Actions ([.github/workflows/test.yml](./.github/workflows/test.yml)) runs on
push to `main`, on every pull request, and nightly at 02:00 UTC:

- **test** — full suite across **2 shards** (matrix).
- **burn-in** — runs the suite **3×** on pull requests to detect flakiness.
- **smoke** — runs only `@smoke` tests on every push.

It caches npm and Playwright browsers, installs chromium with `--with-deps`, and
uploads the HTML report + traces/screenshots as artifacts (7-day retention).

**Required repository secrets:** `BASE_URL`, `ADMIN_USER`, `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.

## MCP server configuration

This project is configured for **MCP browser automation** so an AI agent (e.g.
Claude Code) can drive a live browser via the Playwright MCP server while CI runs
the same specs deterministically.

**Start the MCP server:**

```bash
npx @playwright/mcp@latest --headless --browser chromium
```

**Register with an MCP client** (`.mcp.json` / `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest", "--headless", "--browser", "chromium"]
    }
  }
}
```

The runtime contract (baseURL, chromium, headless, traces) lives in
[playwright.config.ts](./playwright.config.ts) and is shared by both the MCP server
and `npx playwright test`, so generated and committed tests behave identically. See
the MCP note block at the top of that file for details.

## Quality standards (enforced)

- ❌ No `waitForTimeout` / hard waits — network-first only (`waitForURL`, `expect().toBeVisible()`).
- ❌ No `if/else` flow control in test bodies.
- ❌ No CSS / XPath selectors — `getByRole` / `getByLabel` / `getByPlaceholder` only.
- ✅ Page Object Model for all UI interaction.
- ✅ Parallel-safe, self-contained tests with explicit assertion messages.
- ✅ Every test file < 300 lines.

---

## Known issues

- **Demo-site flakiness.** The public OrangeHRM instance is shared and
  network-dependent. Mitigated by `retries: 2` on CI, network-first waits, and the
  burn-in job. A failure may be environmental rather than a product defect.
- **Shared credentials.** `Admin/admin123` is public and could be changed or
  locked on the demo host. Credentials are injected via env/secrets so they can be
  swapped without code changes.
- **Deferred P1 (REQ-11).** Session-not-persisted deep assertions are authored as
  ATDD red-phase scaffolds (skipped) pending activation — see
  [docs/gate-decision.md](./docs/gate-decision.md) (gate: **WAIVED**, path to PASS
  documented).
